WIP libretro frontend.

This program will eventually be a Qt frontend for libretro cores. It is very fragile, but has been shown to work on some cores (mgba, bsnes, gambatte) with audio and save games.

Currently only works on Linux, and requires SDL2 and libretro cores to be installed.

I owe much to understanding how libretro interfaces from this blog post - https://www.retroreversing.com/CreateALibRetroFrontEndInRust
